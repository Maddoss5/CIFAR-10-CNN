Initial accuracy ->10 % when learning rate was too high 

Change Lr to 0.001 
New accuracy -> 61 %

CReate a deeper neural network , 
add more convolutional layers ,
Create data augmentation and instead of it replacing the original data append the augmented data to original data . 
Use droupout =0.4
INcrease batchsize to 128 for dataloader .
New accuracy -> 83 %
